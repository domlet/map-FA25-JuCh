## Why I made this
["My Summer Spots" App](https://juan1o0.github.io/MyMap1/) app record places that have been important to me throughout summers. There are three location that ive spent summer in at one point througout my high school years. This map simply serves as a reminder and tribute to the places that hold a special place in my mind.
## Technology
    
To build this app, I used the following tools:

1. [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides) library, for styling and displaying map popups.
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) free IDE, with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) extensions.
4. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), for publishing the app for free!


## Code Spotlight
_Snippet of Code_

The code in the image provided above is what helps load one of the pop ups on my map. The main part of interest for me was that to get the coordinates to work you would need to put them in in reverse than what you would find on something like google maps. I had to fix a bug where it wouldnt place correctly, i had messed up the order of the coordinates. The main takeaway I had from the experience was that its often needed to double check your code.
